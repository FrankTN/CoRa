# COVID-19 Radiomics

This repo contains a python wrapper for the pyradiomics library. This wrapper is useful for automating the radiomic analysis of a few COVID-19 chest CT datasets. This code was written as part of my master's thesis. 

## Cora (COVID Radiomics) CLI
Cora is a simple command line interface, tailored for use with specific datasets provided in the `data/` folder.

### Installation
To install cora (on Linux systems), navigate to the source folder and run `pip install .`. This will register cora as a command line tool.

### Commands
To show options simply run `cora`.
